**SOLUTION**


#### System Information


    OS: Fedora 41 and 42 Workstation
    CPU: 12th Gen Intel i5-12400F
    GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti
    RAM: 16GB
    Heroic installation method: Flatpak (system-wide)
    Wine version: Wine-GE-Proton8-26. This solution should also work on the newer versions like: GE-Proton10-3 or higher.

If you're playing The Elder Scrolls: Arena through the Heroic Games Launcher on Linux and have no sound, this is because the game uses MIDI for its soundtrack. Here's how I solved this problem by setting up TiMidity++ as a MIDI synthesizer.

**Step 1: Install TiMidity++ and SoundFont**

First, install TiMidity++ and a good general MIDI soundfont:

```sudo dnf install timidity++ fluid-soundfont-gm```

**Step 2: Configure TiMidity**

Edit the TiMidity configuration file:

`sudo nano /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg`

Add the following configuration:

```
# Default configuration
dir /usr/share/soundfonts

# Set default instrument configuration to use Fluid soundfont
source /usr/share/soundfonts/fluid3gm.cfg

# Set basic parameters
opt EFresamp=d
opt EFvlpf=d
opt EFreverb=d
```

**Step 3: Test TiMidity**

Run TiMidity as a MIDI server and check connections:

`timidity -iA`

Then in another terminal:

`aconnect -o`

If everything is working correctly, you should see TiMidity listed as an available MIDI output.

**Step 4: Create a Launch Script**

`nano ~/launch-arena.sh`

The script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Kill any existing timidity instances
killall timidity 2>/dev/null

# Start Timidity in the background
timidity -iA &
TIMIDITY_PID=$!

# Wait a moment for Timidity to initialize
sleep 2

# Launch the game through Heroic using the App ID
flatpak run com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl launch --app-id=1435828982

# Print instructions for the user
echo "========================================"
echo "Timidity is running in the background"
echo "Please click PLAY in the Heroic launcher"
echo "When you're done playing, come back to this terminal and press Ctrl+C"
echo "This will shut down Timidity properly"
echo "========================================"

# Wait for user to press Ctrl+C
trap "kill $TIMIDITY_PID 2>/dev/null; echo 'Timidity stopped.'; exit" INT
wait

```
**Step 5: Make the Script Executable**

`chmod +x ~/launch-arena.sh`

**Step 6: Launch the Game**

Run the script to start TiMidity and launch the game:

`~/launch-arena.sh`

This will open the Heroic Games Launcher with TiMidity running in the background. Navigate to The Elder Scrolls: Arena in the launcher and click Play. The game should now have full MIDI sound support!
